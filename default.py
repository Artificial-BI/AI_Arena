Arena Description:

Set Arena Parameters:

Difficulty: 50%
Danger: 40%
Size: Medium
Describe Arena Atmosphere:

The arena is bathed in a dim, eerie light, casting long shadows on the ground. The air is thick with fog, giving the place a mysterious and ominous feel. 
Ancient, crumbling ruins are scattered throughout the landscape, hinting at a long-forgotten civilization.
Describe Natural Processes:

A constant, howling wind sweeps through the arena, rustling the leaves of gnarled, ancient trees. Occasionally, beams of sunlight pierce through the fog, 
creating fleeting moments of clarity amidst the gloom. The ground trembles slightly, as if the very earth is alive with a slow, rhythmic heartbeat.
Describe Detailed Elements:

In the center of the arena lies a massive, cracked stone altar, surrounded by a ring of jagged rocks. To the east, a murky pond bubbles with strange, 
glowing liquid. Tall, spindly trees tower over the western edge, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. 
Scattered throughout the arena are the remnants of ancient statues, 
their features worn away by time, yet still exuding an aura of forgotten power."""},
