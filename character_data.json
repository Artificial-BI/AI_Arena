    "description": "Shadowfang is a master of stealth and silent death.  He was orphaned at a young age and raised on the streets, learning the art of deception and combat from the shadows.  He honed his skills with knives to a razor's edge, becoming a deadly assassin feared throughout the land. He prefers to work alone, striking from the darkness and leaving no trace.  His speed and accuracy are unmatched, and he is able to blend into any environment, making him virtually invisible to his enemies.  He carries a collection of specially crafted knives, each designed for a different purpose, from throwing to close combat. Shadowfang's ruthlessness and cunning make him a formidable opponent."
