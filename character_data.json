    "description": "Ursus is a towering, battle-hardened bear, a sentient creature of immense strength and ferocity.  His thick fur and tough hide offer natural armor, making him incredibly durable. He moves with surprising agility despite his size, capable of surprising speed and bursts of power. Ursus is a skilled fighter, his claws and teeth honed by years of battling both beasts and men. He is a creature of instinct and raw power, rarely relying on strategy or cunning. Ursus has no magical abilities, but his sheer physical prowess makes him a formidable opponent.  His history is shrouded in mystery, but rumors spread of him being a lone survivor of a forgotten tribe of sentient bears, driven to wander the wilderness, fighting for survival.  He is a solitary creature, rarely interacting with other beings, but has a fierce loyalty to those he deems worthy. He is a force of nature, a living weapon, a legend whispered in the hushed tones of those who survive encounters with him."
