# AI Arena: Updated Project Description

## Project Goal:
AI Arena is a networked game where players can create unique characters, visualize them using neural networks, participate in battles, and compete against other players. The game leverages multimodal models to generate images, descriptions, and battle analysis, creating an engaging environment for interaction and competition.

## Project Objectives:
1. **Character Creation and Management:**
   - Players can create characters with unique traits and descriptions, visualized through neural networks.
   - Management and editing of characters through a user-friendly interface.

2. **Dynamic Battle Mechanics:**
   - Real-time battles using AI-driven tactics.
   - Inclusion of automatic and semi-automatic modes with player participation in tactical decisions.

3. **Game Modes:**
   - Support for automatic, semi-automatic, and manual game modes.
   - A separate viewer mode allowing spectators to watch battles without participating in tactics chat.

4. **User Interface and Interaction:**
   - User-friendly interface for players, administrators, and spectators, with communication through chats.
   - Support for multiplayer interaction, including chat systems and moderation.

5. **AI-Driven Visualization and Analysis:**
   - The multimodal model is used to create character and arena images, analyze battles, and generate tactics.
   - Tactical decision-making is managed through `tactics_manager.py`, allowing flexible strategy adjustments during battles.

## Project Architecture and Components:

### Backend:
- **Flask Application (`app.py`)**: The main server handling requests and managing routes for players, spectators, and administrators.
- **Routes:**
  - **Players (`player_routes.py`)**: Managing player profiles, character creation and editing, and battle participation.
  - **Arena (`arena_routes.py`)**: Logic for organizing arena battles, managing waiting lists, and conducting fights.
  - **Viewers (`viewer_routes.py`)**: A separate interface for spectators to watch battles without participating in tactics chat.
  - **Main Page (`index_routes.py`)**: Tournament tables, player statistics, access to arenas, and other functionalities.
  - **Administration (`admin_routes.py`)**: Managing system settings, users, and monitoring activity.

### Frontend:
- **Templates (`base.html`, `player.html`, `arena.html`)**: Responsible for the visual representation of data on the user side, including character management, arenas, and chat.
- **JavaScript and CSS**: Static files for dynamic interaction, building trait charts, and enhancing the user experience.

### Business Logic:
- **Tactics Management (`tactics_manager.py`)**: Logic for selecting and applying tactical decisions during battles.
- **Core Application Logic (`core.py`)**: Ensuring interaction between components, handling messages, managing character registration, and participation in battles.

### Data and Configuration:
- **Data Models (`models.py`)**: The database structure, including models for users, players, characters, and battles.
- **Application Configuration (`config.py`)**: Settings used to control the application's behavior, including timeout parameters, file paths, and other key variables.

## Development and Modifications:
The AI Arena project is continuously evolving. For example, the viewer route (`viewer_routes.py`) will be modified to be a clone of the arena but without participation in tactics chat. This allows spectators to watch battles without directly influencing their outcome.

## Conclusion:
AI Arena is a complex platform that combines game elements, AI-driven content generation, and competitive interaction. With powerful tools for managing tactics and characters, it offers players a unique experience and immersion into the world of AI-driven battles.

# AI Arena: Gameplay Walkthrough

## 1. Registration and Login
- **Registration:** 
  - Players create an account by providing a username, email address, and password.
  - After registration, the player receives a unique identifier, which will be used to track their progress in the game.
- **Login:** 
  - After registration, players can log in using their credentials.

## 2. Character Creation
- **Step 1: Providing Character Preferences**
  - The player describes to the assistant the type of character they want, including preferences for playstyle, traits, and appearance.
  - **Example:** The player requests a character with strong magical abilities and high speed.

- **Step 2: Character Generation by the Assistant**
  - Based on the player's preferences, the assistant automatically generates the character's name, description, traits, and image.
  - The player cannot independently modify the character's traits but can change the name and description.

- **Step 3: Character Confirmation**
  - The player reviews the generated character, including traits and image, and makes any necessary changes to the name and description.
  - Once confirmed, the character is saved in the system and is ready to participate in battles.

## 3. Arena Selection and Battle Participation
- **Step 1: Battle Registration**
  - The player selects their character to participate in a battle. The arena is automatically generated based on the traits of all participants.
  - Players cannot choose the arena themselves; it is dynamically created to reflect the unique characteristics of the characters involved in the battle.

- **Step 2: Battle Start**
  - Once a sufficient number of players have gathered in the arena, the battle begins.
  - Players are transported to the arena, where they can see their opponents and the surrounding environment.

## 4. Arena Interaction
- **Step 1: Tactical Decisions**
  - During the battle, the player makes decisions that influence the outcome, such as choosing to attack, defend, or use special abilities.
  - **Example:** The player decides to use a powerful magical attack against an opponent with low magic resistance.

- **Step 2: Using the Chat**
  - The player can communicate with other participants through the general chat.
  - Explicit alliances are not currently supported in the game, so each player fights for themselves.

- **Step 3: Battle Dynamics**
  - AI Arena calculates the outcome of each action in real-time, evaluating character traits and tactical decisions.
  - **Example:** If the player's character lands a successful hit, the opponent may lose significant health, potentially altering the course of the battle.

## 5. Battle Conclusion and Scoring
- **Step 1: End of Battle**
  - The battle concludes when one participant defeats all opponents or when the allotted battle time expires.
  - The player receives a notification about the battle's end.

- **Step 2: Scoring**
  - AI Arena calculates final scores based on the character's actions, damage dealt, survivability, and other factors.
  - **Example:** The player earns extra points for successful tactical decisions and surviving until the end of the battle.

- **Step 3: Tournament Ranking Update**
  - The battle results impact the player's ranking in the tournament leaderboard. The better the performance, the higher the rank.
  - **Example:** After a successful battle, the player moves up several positions in the leaderboard, increasing their chances of winning the tournament.

## 6. Post-Battle Interaction
- **Analysis and Discussion**
  - The player can analyze their actions and discuss the battle with other participants through the general chat or AI Arena forums.
  - **Example:** The player discusses the strategy that helped them win and receives tips on improving their tactics.

- **Preparation for the Next Battle**
  - After the battle, the player can create a new character, improve an existing one, or register for the next battle.
  - **Example:** The player decides to improve their character's agility to be more effective in the next fight.

## Conclusion
AI Arena offers players a unique opportunity to immerse themselves in strategic battles where every step and decision can influence the outcome. The assistant helps players create characters and arenas, providing a balanced and engaging gaming environment. Climbing the leaderboard and refining tactics become the main goals for each participant.
