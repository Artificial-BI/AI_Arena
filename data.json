    "description": "Djin is a mischievous Djinn bound to a magical lamp. He possesses immense magical power, able to manipulate elements and grant wishes, but his intelligence often leads to unintended consequences. With a sly grin and a penchant for pranks, Djin's cunning and quick wit make him a formidable opponent. His mastery of illusions and teleportation allows him to vanish and reappear at will, leaving his foes bewildered. While lacking physical strength, his speed and agility make him a hard target to hit. However, his limited stamina and poor defense make him vulnerable to sustained attacks. Djin was once a powerful sorcerer in the ancient world, but after an ill-fated experiment, he was bound to the lamp as punishment. Now, he seeks to regain his freedom and restore his former glory, even if it means playing tricks and manipulating those who wish upon him."
