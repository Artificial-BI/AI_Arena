    "description": "Grok is a small, wiry goblin with a mischievous glint in his beady eyes. Despite his lack of intelligence, he possesses a surprising amount of cunning and agility.  He's a skilled hunter and tracker, able to move silently through the forest and utilize traps and ambushes with surprising effectiveness. While his strength is limited, he compensates with a quick blade and a knack for finding weak points in his opponents. Grok's luck is often a double-edged sword; he tends to escape perilous situations with surprising ease, but his schemes often go awry. He lives for the thrill of the hunt, and his loyalty is easily bought with a promise of riches or a chance to prove his strength. Grok's life has been a constant struggle for survival in the unforgiving wilderness, and he possesses a ruthless streak that makes him a dangerous opponent."
