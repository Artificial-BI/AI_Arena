    "description": "Hulk is a towering, green-skinned behemoth with incredible strength and resilience. His rage fuels his power, making him a fearsome warrior in battle. He is a simple, primal being driven by instinct and emotion. While possessing limited intelligence, Hulk's raw power and ferocity make him a formidable opponent.  He has a deep connection to his primal instincts, allowing him to withstand immense pain and physical trauma.  His anger is a double-edged sword; it makes him powerful but also prone to uncontrolled rage, making him difficult to control in combat. Despite his savage nature, Hulk has a surprising degree of compassion and loyalty to his friends, albeit expressed in his own unique and often destructive way."
