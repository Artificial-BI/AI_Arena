His reputation precedes him, a mix of fear and respect from those who know his name. Orion is known for his unwavering dedication to justice and his ruthless efficiency in dealing with threats to the Galactic Federation.

His high speed and stamina make him an effective pursuer, capable of tirelessly tracking down criminals across vast distances. His intelligence is primarily practical, focusing on tactics, weaponry, and survival in hostile environments. He possesses a cold demeanor and a straightforward approach to danger, preferring direct action over diplomacy. \n\nOrion carries a customized plasma rifle, a weapon he\u2019s modified to deliver devastating bursts of energy. He also wields a vibro-blade, a versatile tool for close-quarters combat. He has a keen eye and utilizes his knowledge of the galaxy's diverse ecosystems to his advantage, often using the environment to his benefit during combat. Orion is a dedicated warrior, willing to sacrifice everything to uphold the law and protect the innocent.",
