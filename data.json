    "description": "Ursus the Mighty is a massive brown bear, a hulking warrior born of the wild. His strength is legendary, allowing him to crush stone and cleave through steel with his bare paws. He is a master of combat, wielding a heavy axe with brutal efficiency. His thick fur and tough hide provide him with natural armor, making him incredibly difficult to harm.  While he may not be the quickest or the most cunning, Ursus's sheer strength and unyielding determination make him a formidable force on the battlefield. Ursus was raised by the ancient spirit of the forest, imbued with the primal power of the wild. He is a protector of nature and its inhabitants, standing against any who would threaten the balance of the forest. His loyalty is unwavering, and his rage is as fierce as a raging storm.",
