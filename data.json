    "description": "Lyra Vega is a seasoned Space Ranger, known for her quick reflexes and deadly aim. She honed her skills in the harsh environments of the outer colonies, where survival relied on both cunning and courage. She is a master of hand-to-hand combat, utilizing a combination of martial arts and her trusty energy pistol. Her intelligence is sharp, allowing her to quickly adapt to new situations and formulate strategies on the fly. However, her reliance on technology and her skeptical nature make her hesitant towards mystical or supernatural abilities. Despite her gruff exterior, Lyra has a strong sense of justice and a deep compassion for those in need, particularly the innocent victims of galactic conflicts. She carries a worn leather jacket, a testament to countless missions and close calls, and a small, intricate pendant of a celestial compass, a reminder of her lost home planet. Her luck, while not her strongest asset, has seen her through countless perilous situations, fueled by a relentless spirit and unwavering determination.",
