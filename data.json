    "description": "Grog Smashfist is a hulking Orc warrior, known for his brute strength and unwavering loyalty to his clan. Raised in the harsh conditions of the Orcish wilderness, Grog learned to fight from a young age, mastering the art of wielding a massive two-handed axe with devastating force.  His thick hide and imposing stature make him a formidable opponent in any battle.  Despite his intimidating appearance, Grog is surprisingly simple-minded, often preferring a direct approach to any problem, even if it means charging headlong into danger. He has little interest in diplomacy or strategy, trusting his instincts and his axe to see him through. His loyalty to his clan is unwavering, and he would gladly sacrifice himself for their well-being.  His only ambition is to prove his worth in battle, gaining recognition as a mighty warrior and earning the respect of his tribe."
